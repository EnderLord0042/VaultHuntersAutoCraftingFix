# Vault Hunters Autocrafting Fix
In the Vault Hunters Modpack, autocrafting is extremely expensive. This is because this modpack implements a research system. Autocrafting blocks do not know which player's reseach tree to use, and thus they can craft all blocks. This mod fixes this by making autocrafting blocks use the research tree of the largest research sharing group in a world. This mod does not change the research requirements for crafting autocrafting blocks. You can do this yourself in the Vault Hunter config.
